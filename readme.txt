Adds userfriendly multilingual content management and translation support into Wordpress.

== Description ==

I create Ceceppa Multilingua to let Wordpress have an easy to use interface for managing a fully multilingual web site.
With "Ceceppa Multilingua" you can write your posts and pages in multiple language. Here are some features:

- Different menu for each language.
- Translate widget's title.
- Group/Ungroup comments for each post's languages.
- Show notice when the post/page/category that user is viewing is available, based on the information provided by the browser, in their its language
- Redirects the browser depending on the user's language. Append the suffix &lang= to the home page
- Least Read Posts, Most Commented, Most Read Posts can show only the posts in user selected language
